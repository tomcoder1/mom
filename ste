In the field of economics, living conditions of human beings are soaring day by day. However, there has been an argument that in developed nations, elevation in economic wealth can’t meet the satisfaction of the inhabitants. I completely disagree with this idea and in this essay, I will give my reasons for my statement.
Initially, it would be totally wrong to say that rich countries don’t need an increase in the economy on the grounds that there are a profusion of people in those nations who require an improvement in their life. Such individuals are suffering from poverty, homelessness, hungriness and so on.  As a matter of fact, in the USA, which is the richest country, 20% of its citizens are homeless, which is higher than most developing countries. 
Secondly, had it not been for an element of growth in the world’s economy, there would have been a global economic crisis. The reason behind this phenomenon is fairly simple: when there is no development, the workers will be demotivated. Therefore, the globe’s production chain will be severely damaged. In fact, in Argentina, the inflation rate is notably high because of owing to the residents’ positivity that nothing would go wrong.  
To recapitulate, I completely disagree with the fact that an addition in the value of a rich country is unnecessary. The reasons for my disagreement is that: there are a myriad of people living in bad conditions in those nations and the economy of the nation will go down if there will be no elevation in the economic wealth.
